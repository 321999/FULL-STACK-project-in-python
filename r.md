in this the app  are accounts core home 

app is like which contains all the modules of project 

django app are reusable 
bootup means start or runserver 

if u want to run ur project on particular port u can do the followig 
0.0.0.0:5000
 each 0 represent the 8 bit character ie is 32 bit character
 with column 5000 represent the port number 

how to start with the html response in django that  we know it should be done in template folder 
how to return the data from backend 
  

there are two types of view one is class based and another one function based view

frontend file that is html file should be inside the templates 
- check the spelling of templates and put all ur frontend file insde this 

js file should be  writtain with the html file 
    
    to send the data from backend to template we use context 


    ```
           {%for p in loyal%}
            <tr>
                <!-- <td></td> -->
                <!-- <td>1</td> instead of doing this we can dynamically couner the value -->
                <td>{{forloop.counter}}</td>
                <!-- for loop counter is used to dynamically change the value -->
                <td>{{p.NAME}}</td>
                <!-- <td>3</td> -->
                <!-- <td>{{p.age}}</td>
                 -->
                <td>{{p.AGE}}</td>


            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
    ```
    THis behave like for loop which is writin inside %%  and ended with the for end  and we can see teh logic writain with the name p 

    when u dont reuere the thing dont comment it just delete it 
    ```
           <!-- <td {% if p.AGE>18 %} style="background-color:green" {% elif p.AGE == 18 %} style="background-color:greenyellow" {% else %} style:"background-color:red">{% if p.AGE > 18 %}                   âœ” -->
    ```


    in oop we should notrepeate the same code again and again
this results redundant nature  this concept  is called DRY means do not reapte urself 
     
     for this wecan use block tag of django 
    
{% extends "product/base.html" %}
#### TemplateDoesNotExist at /about/

![Alt text](image.png)

context={'title':'contact'}  it should be in single quote 

whatever writtain above the <% block block_name %> is copied and accessible everywhere 

<% blockend %> 
code writtain below this is also accessible everywhere     

and code writtain inside the block tag cannot be accessible everywhere 

```

```
### filter 
means filter the text in upper lower or else by using a pipe(|)
- {{text|lower}}
- {{text|upper}}
- {{text|escape|linebreaks|truncatewords:30}}
- {{list|join:","}}
* to convert the list text to string 
the output of one filter can apply to next 


#### models and migration
schema is like structure 
like student is the name of structure in that what name age class marks are attriute 
this is called the structure 

```
class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
first name and last name are the field of model,each field are the attribute of a class and each attribute are maps to a database column 
each attribute maps to a database column  


    # t hsi is the primary key which is autogenerated 
    # primary key is thekey which is used to uniquely identify the records of a table ti  isunique andnot null
bydefault database of django is the sqlite 
for thsi first we have to make the schema also called the modes 
this is done in models.py which recides in every app 

inside the models.py create the models by using the class 
```
class name_of_models(models.Model):
    field1 
    field2
    field3
    .
    .
    .
    fieldn 

```
##### migrations are the the process of managing changes to the database schema 
if u alter the db schema u have to enter the command python manage.py makemigrations
aftere this the new file is created with the dependency in it as app name and with the previous init file 

to push this changes or save this data in to the db we have to enter the command 
python manage.py migrate 

the important things in this is that dont delte the dependency even after saving the main file in db 
in every theere is folder of migration which is used 
wirte the command as * python manage.py make *


when we hit the command the python manage.py migrate 
it will run all the migrations file and and make the states and that states are compare  with the db schema and whichever there it will make the chages
